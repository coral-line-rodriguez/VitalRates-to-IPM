# Coral Vital Rates and Integral Projection Models
SfM photogrammetry was used to create orthoprojections. Each site was annotated to estimate vital rates 
(growth, survival, recruitment) for the 7 dominant species in Hawaii.
Vital rates were used to parameterize Integral Projection Models (IPMs) and assess the relationship between
thermal stress and the population growth rate, lambda.

The R/VitalRateFunctions_old.Rmd script uses the vital rates dataset to model different vital rate functions, which is the first step in building an Integral Projection Model.
